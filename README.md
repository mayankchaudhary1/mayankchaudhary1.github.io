I created by Web portfolio using Bootstrap for designing and some Javascript for the animation effects. I didn't face any major challeneges as I took special care of breakpoints and made sure no horizontal scrolling bar appears. I had this pron=blem in my past assignments so I learnt the Grid Layout and and used Flexbox to properly place my elements.
